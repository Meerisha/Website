<p>Here's my recipe for Manty, a traditional dish from Central Asia:

    Ingredients:
    
    500g flour
    200ml warm water
    1 egg
    250g ground lamb or beef
    1 onion, finely chopped
    2-3 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tsp cumin
    1 tsp paprika
    Salt and pepper to taste
    Vegetable oil for frying
    Water for steaming
    Instructions:
    
    In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, egg, and warm water. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
    
    While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
    
    Roll out the dough into a thin layer, about 2-3mm thick. Using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out circles from the dough.
    
    Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle.
    
    Pinch the edges of the dough circle together to form a closed pouch, with the filling inside. Make sure to seal the edges tightly to prevent the filling from leaking out.
    
    In a large pot, bring some water to a boil. Place a steamer basket or a colander on top of the pot.
    
    Place the manty on the steamer basket, making sure they don't touch each other. Steam for 15-20 minutes, until the dough is cooked and the filling is hot.
    
    Heat some vegetable oil in a frying pan. Once the manty are steamed, transfer them to the frying pan and fry until they are lightly browned on the outside.
    
    Serve the manty hot with some sour cream or tomato sauce on the side.
    
    Enjoy your delicious Manty dish!</p>
